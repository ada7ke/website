        Hi, I’m Ada! I’m a sophomore in high school living in Seattle, WA. I first discovered coding back in 2nd grade through Scratch, and I was instantly hooked. I loved the freedom to create anything I imagined and the challenge of figuring out how to solve problems step by step. Since then, I’ve explored many different types of coding projects and enjoyed branching out into new areas.
        Outside of coding, I also love photography, debate, and snowboarding. I’ve had the chance to share my passions with others by teaching classes at a summer camp in Jingdezhen, where I led coding, sports, arts, and science sessions. That experience taught me how rewarding it is to help others learn—not just to understand something myself, but to see the moment when it clicks for someone else.

      <p>
        When I teach, I focus on building real understanding of concepts and strong problem-solving skills, not just rote memorization. Every programming language has its own syntax, but the core ideas behind them stay the same. Once you understand those foundations, you can adapt to any language out there. The same is true for problem solving, as real-world challenges are always new, so memorizing solutions isn’t enough. What actually matters is learning how to think through problems and approach them effectively.

        ScratchI am experienced in several languages including Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, C++, C#, and Java. Scratch is where I first started learning coding. I've used python for many different things, including web scrapers and different games.
