      <div class="faq-question">Why learn programming?</div>

        I work with students from ages 8 and up, focusing on personalized coding instruction tailored to their level.

      <div class="faq-question">What programming language should I learn?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        For younger kids (7-10), I recommend starting with Scratch because it is very visual and doesn't require much typing skills. For older kids, I recommend starting with Python because it is very intuitive, useful for many applications and is easy to transition from Scratch if that applies to your student. For students who specifically want to learn web development, HTML/CSS/JS is the best option. For students who want to learn game development, C++ is the most common language in the industry.

      <div class="faq-question">What language are classes taught in?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        I can teach classes in either English or Chinese, although I highly recommend utilizing this opportunity to practice your student's English skills, and because most text-based languages inherently use English.
